Our current preoccupation with zombies and vampires is easy to explain. They're two sides of the same coin, addressing our fascination with sex, death and food. They're both undead, they both feed on us, they both pass on some kind of plague and they can both be killed with specialist techniques – a stake through the heart or a disembraining. But they seem to have become polarised. Vampires are the undead of choice for girls, and zombies for boys. Vampires are cool, aloof, beautiful, brooding creatures of the night. Typical moody teenage boys, basically. Zombies are dumb, brutal, ugly and mindlessly violent. Which makes them also like typical teenage boys, I suppose.

要解釋我們現在對殭屍與吸血鬼的痴迷， 似乎並不困難。它們如同一枚硬幣的正反面，均以其性感、死亡與特殊的主食迎合著我們的好奇心。它們長生不老，以人類為食，傳播某種瘟疫，並且需要特殊手段 才能被殺死----釘入心臟的木樁或者挖出腦子。但它們似乎被極端化了。永生的吸血鬼是女孩們的選擇，而殭屍則更符合男孩們的胃口。吸血鬼冷酷、孤傲、俊 美、晝伏夜出，正如喜怒無常的十幾歲男孩。殭屍則沉默寡言，凶殘，醜陋，頭腦簡單，脾氣狂躁，也同樣是十幾歲男孩的典型特徵。
